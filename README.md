# 🎮 Game Analytics Dashboard

This project analyzes game payments and user behavior to track revenue and user metrics.  
Metrics were calculated with SQL queries on **PostgreSQL**, and visualized using **Tableau Public**.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal was to build an interactive **dashboard** to monitor a gaming platform’s revenue and user behavior.  
We aimed to answer the following questions:

- How is the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) changing over time?  
- What are the trends in the number of paid users and ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paid User)?  
- How many new users are being acquired, and how many are being lost?  
- What is the churn rate?  
- What is the Expansion and Contraction MRR?  
- What are the Customer Lifetime (LT) and Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)?
